    "q": "Two friends start at the same time, walk in opposite directions along a straight road, and each takes exactly 3 hours. One walks 1.5 times faster than the other. Who is ahead when they’ve each walked half the distance of the starting points? (Explain briefly.)",
    "a": "The faster friend is ahead at halfway, because they cover more distance in the same time; at half the total distance, their lead equals (speed difference) × (time).",
    "hint": "Set speeds as v and 1.5v, total distance D. After t = (D/2)/(average speed), compare distances."
