Group 2 pairs animal sounds with their vocalizations; very direct, but ensure students map sound to animal. Group 3 centers on craft supplies typically used together. Group 4 uses phrase constructions with 'stick' where some options (like 'password stick') are not valid phrases; stick figure and drum stick are valid; others are near-misses to demonstrate why they don’t fit. Ensure kids focus on common, unambiguous phrases."
