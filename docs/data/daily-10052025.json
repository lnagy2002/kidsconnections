(4) Pairs group relies on items typically worn or used in pairs; some items like 'glasses' are worn on the face and are a natural pair."

(2) Word growth by one letter is a clean, but careful, pattern; all items should be reachable by adding one letter to a base word with clear sense. (3) Fictional neighborhoods keep it safe and imaginative; ensure names are distinct. (4) Plant parts are concrete; ensure the connection to other groups isn’t stronger (e.g., leaf could plausibly be a color name in rare cases; avoid ambiguity). Near-miss temptation: 'orange' could tempt as fruit in the color group but the group is color-name overlaps with fruit, so it’s intended to be color-name linkage."
