Category 3 lists common household items; Category 4 lists basic color words tied to emotions conceptually but keep distinct from the other groups. Near-miss temptation: 'green' and 'blue' could seem related to mood, but in this puzzle they are treated as color tokens; they do not cross into emotional meanings. All items are unambiguous and age-appropriate; no overlap between groups."
