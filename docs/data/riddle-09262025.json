    "q": "A tailor makes three hats from a single piece of fabric. If he cuts off a corner to form a triangle, what is the smallest number of cuts needed to make all three hats perfect circles? (Think in terms of transformation, not actual sewing.)",
    "a": "Zero; you can’t make hats from a circle fabric without folding or stitching, but if you interpret the problem as a trick, the answer is to realize circles can’t be formed from triangles without cuts; the riddle is about thinking differently.",
    "hint": "Consider shapes and what constitutes a 'hat' shape."
