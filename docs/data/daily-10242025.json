Near-miss: 'bear' could fit Animals by Home or Things with Fur; clarified by context in this puzzle."

Near-miss temptation: 'cloud' could be both a weather term and a shape metaphor; it clearly belongs to Shapes in the Sky here."

Near-miss temptation: 'glass' could be a material or a container; here it's kept as a material but note overlap with 'bottle' is avoided by focusing on size category for the group."
