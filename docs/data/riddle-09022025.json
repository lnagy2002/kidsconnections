    "q": "A farmer has a rectangular field. He wants to plant seeds so every row is the same length as the field’s width, but he cannot measure. How could he lay them out so that all rows fit perfectly without measuring?",

    "hint": "Think about using the field’s dimensions to create equal rows without explicit measurement."
