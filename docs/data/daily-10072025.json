(4) Shapes and uses: classic geometric names paired with common objects. Near-miss: 'Sun' could be part of 'Sunflower' or 'Sunrise' concept, but only 'Sunflower' is used to keep the fit clear."

(4) Everyday with a twist: ordinary items that can be grouped by a less obvious trait (e.g., items that come in sets or are commonly carried). Near-miss temptation: 'Clock' might fit both Movement and Color Change in some views, but it is not included to maintain exclusivity."
