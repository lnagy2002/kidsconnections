Prefix Partners show common word pairs with shared prefixes that alter meaning. Cute Compounds are familiar compound words. Hidden Shape items are ordinary objects that also evoke a simple shape idea (pillow: roundish, plate: round). Near-miss temptation was avoided by ensuring no item could fit two groups convincingly; e.g., 'sunflower' is clearly a compound, not a single fragment in Word Fragments."
