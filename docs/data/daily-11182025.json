(4) Kitchen Drawer items are everyday tools grouped by common use. Near-miss temptation: 'spoon' could be mistaken for a cooking tool in multiple groups, but in this puzzle it clearly belongs to Kitchen Drawer tools; other items are not kitchen tools, reducing overlap. The items are kept kid-friendly and unambiguous."
